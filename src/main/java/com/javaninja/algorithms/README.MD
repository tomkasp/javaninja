Why use tries? 

- search, insert/delete, items quickly 
- ordered arrays are bad at insertions/deletions
- finding items in linked a linked list is slow
- time needed to perform an operation on a tree is O(logN)
- on average tree is more efficient when you need to perform many different types of operation
